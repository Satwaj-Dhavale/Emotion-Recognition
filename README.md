# Description
This project is based off on an AI model trained using a CNN deep learning architecture to predict sentiment or emotion of the person in the user given image or video.

This project uses flask to provide users with a web interface where they can upload an image or a video and get an output file.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in the project is the FER-2013 dataset acquired from [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

The class labels in the above dataset are "anger", "disgust", "fear", "happy", "sadness", "surprise" and "neutral".


# Requirements

The requirements are provided in the Requirements.txt file.


# Usage
1.> If you want to create your own model, change models.py to your liking and train the model to generate weights.
				 
2.> Run app_run.py and visit "192.168.1.2" on a browser to access the web interface.
